Comments:
---------
problem 6-1, VERY complete analysis ~ nicely done!

problem 6-2, Text is not a shape, it should be a subclass of Drawable.  You
   should also have a 'fillable' class, which should be under shape.  Shape
   should be called 'LineDrawable' and 'Line' should be a subclass of it.

Excellent work ~ keep it up!
