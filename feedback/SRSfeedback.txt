Software Requirements Specification &
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4072 Spring 2025
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Not required for this semester's exercise

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   This is a good start, but you need quite a few more requirements to fully
   specify your application.  Either additional 'shall' statements or some
   'will' statements to augment what you have are needed.  For example, in
   5.3.1 you have:

         The web application shall first display the login main page for
         students and teachers.

   ...but what about what is ON that page?  Is it different for students and
   teachers?  What is different and what will they each see?  How will the
   user tell the program that they are finished entering data ~ press 'enter'
   or click a button?  Or will both be available?  You see the idea here...

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   These are excellent!  Good job on this section, nothing else needed.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   These are find, too.  Good job on this section, nothing else needed.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   Category                          Points
   Component Breakdown                 2/2
   Functional Requirements           4.5/5
   Performance Requirements            2/2
   Environment Requirements            1/1
                                     =====
   Subtotal                         9.5/10
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:  9.5/10 = 95% which is an A

Very good start on this, just add some more requirements if you want, to get
that other 1/2 point.
