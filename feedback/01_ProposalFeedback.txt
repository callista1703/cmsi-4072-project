Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Educational Social App
===============================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   This was supposed to be an augmented version of your original proposal
   document that states what you will be adding on this semester.  The only
   thing that seems different with this second version is that you removed
   the 'assignment' description part from the start of the document.  All of
   the other text seems to be the same.

   So what is NEW?  What are you adding to last semester?

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
   Nice work on the presentation.  I like the minimalist approach you have
   done using B&W as the theme.  The picture on the first page is nice, too.
   You might have added just a couple more graphics to highlight some of the
   parts of your project ~ pictures help a lot.

   One thing to note for next time is, try not to put too much text together
   on a single slide.  Bullets are usually better than paragraphs.  Your POV
   and Justification pages are a bit dense in that regard.  Think about this
   as showing just the 'highlights' of what you will say in your talk.

   For example, on your POV page you could have a single student example, on
   a side-by-side comparison, without the application and then with it, so
   the audience can see how your application will be useful.

   One other thing to note is, spread out a bit more across the 'stage' so
   that the audience pays more attention to you, and SPEAK UP to hold their
   focus.

   Otherwise, good job!

Summary:
--------
Total:  4% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Not bad, overall, but make sure you are reading the specification for each
assignment carefully so you know what is required.
